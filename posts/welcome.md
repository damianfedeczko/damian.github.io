Hello there!

My name is Damian and it's my pleasure to welcome to my GitHub page. I've decided that this will be my platform for something widely understood as "knowledge-sharing". This means that you may expect different types of content here - starting from technical blog posts, code snippets, WarGames writeups, and ending with some silly stuff I just wanted to share.

Feel free to contact me at anytime via e-mail if you want to get in touch.

Thanks!

Damian
