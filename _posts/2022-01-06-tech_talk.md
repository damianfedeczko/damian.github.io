Back in August 2021, together with my collegue from CodiLime - Paweł Gołębiewski - I had the opportunity to be a co-presenter of a tech talk about a custom, in-house tool created in our company for cloud cost control in software development projects. If you are interested, go through the webinar summary and watch the video.

By the way - yes, I'm aware about the quality of my performance - but please, don't be too harsh and have in mind that this was my first live tech talk :)

Public clouds are now indispensable in modern software development. They offer flexibility, scalability and high availability. In the cloud, for example, you can easily and quickly test a solution without investing in hardware. At the same time, cloud cost management can be tricky, and generate unwanted spend. If resources are created automatically and you miss something in your code, your entire monthly budget can go up in flames in a single weekend. With bigger projects, these costs can run into the thousands of dollars monthly.

In this webinar, you will learn:

- How to use the native mechanism of public clouds to build a cloud cost-optimization solution
- How to implement it easily
- How to make it work automatically
- How to do it at virtually no cost
