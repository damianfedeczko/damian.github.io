Back in August of 2021, together with my collegue from CodiLime - Paweł Gołębiewski - we gave a tech talk about a custom in-house tool created for cloud cost control in software development projects. If you are interested - watch the video.

Public clouds are now indispensable in modern software development. They offer flexibility, scalability and high availability. In the cloud, for example, you can easily and quickly test a solution without investing in hardware. At the same time, cloud cost management can be tricky, and generate unwanted spend. If resources are created automatically and you miss something in your code, your entire monthly budget can go up in flames in a single weekend. With bigger projects, these costs can run into the thousands of dollars monthly.

In this webinar, you will learn:

- How to use the native mechanism of public clouds to build a cloud cost-optimization solution
- How to implement it easily
- How to make it work automatically
- How to do it at virtually no cost
