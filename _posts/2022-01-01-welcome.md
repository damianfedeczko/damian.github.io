Hello there!

My name is Damian and it's my pleasure to welcome you on my GitHub page. I've decided that this will be my platform for something widely understood as "knowledge-sharing". This means that you may expect different types of content here - starting from technical blog posts, code snippets, WarGames writeups, certifications exams experiences and ending with some silly stuff I just wanted to share.

Feel free to contact me at anytime via e-mail if you want to get in touch.

Thanks!

Damian
